# Console-Emulator
This project is intended as an independent case study on several processors, and trying to recreate (or emulate) the hardware to a certain degree from a software perspective.

# SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) 
To begin the program, you need a visualizer to draw graphics to the screen, and read keypresses. This is where SDL comes in: https://www.libsdl.org/
(Compilation of SDL files, "gcc [Filename] -o [DesiredName] -I /path/to/sdl/include -lSDL2")
